# Repo Generators

This plugin generates an empty repository and repository-wide artifacts such as
Storybook support. Please see
[Repo plugin](https://code-shaper.dev/docs/reference/repo-plugin) for details.

> Warning: Do not remove the `.ejs.t` extension from the `.gitignore.ejs.t`
> template. If you name it simply as `.gitignore`, npm will not bundle it when
> publishing. See https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3763.
